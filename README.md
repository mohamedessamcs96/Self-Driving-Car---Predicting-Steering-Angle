## Overview

This project explores the development of a deep learning model to assist in the autonomous navigation of vehicles by predicting the optimal steering angle based on visual and driving data. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can teach the model to interpret the road and suggest steering corrections in real-time.

## Features

- Predicts steering angle based on input images and driving data
- Uses a CNN-based architecture for real-time decision-making
- Provides tools for data visualization and model performance evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images and telemetry data such as steering angles from a self-driving car. Each sample includes:
- Input image: Captures the forward-facing view from the car
- Telemetry: Recorded steering angle associated with each image

You can find or generate similar datasets through open-source simulators or real-world driving logs.

## Model Architecture

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by Nvidia's architecture for self-driving cars, optimized for predicting steering angles from images and relevant sensor data. Key layers include:
1. Convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies in image data
2. Fully connected layers to map image features to steering angles
3. ReLU activations to introduce non-linearity
4. Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-driving-car-steering-prediction.git
   cd self-driving-car-steering-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images and steering angle data for model training. Run the preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --data_path <path_to_your_data>
   ```

2. **Training the Model**: Train the CNN model on your dataset:

   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs <num_epochs> --batch_size <batch_size>
   ```

3. **Model Inference**: Use the trained model to predict steering angles for a new set of images:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --model <path_to_trained_model> --input <path_to_test_images>
   ```

## Results
